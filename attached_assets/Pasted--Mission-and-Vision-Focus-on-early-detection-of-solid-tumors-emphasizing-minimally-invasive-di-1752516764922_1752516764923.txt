### Mission and Vision
- Focus on early detection of solid tumors, emphasizing minimally invasive diagnostic and imaging strategies to identify cancer at curable stages.
- Expanded vision to include precision treatment, extending beyond cancer to other diseases like neurology, cardiology, and autoimmune conditions.
- Goal of saving lives through basic and translational research, interdisciplinary education, and outreach for underserved communities.
- Paradigm shifts, such as recognizing most high-grade serous ovarian cancers originate from precursors in the fallopian tubes (STIC lesions).
- Commitment to developing low-cost, accessible tools like point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) for confirmation of biomarkers (e.g., CA-125 for ovarian, CA-19 for pancreas).

### History and Founding
- Founded in 2004 by Don Listwin following his mother Grace Listwin's death from late-stage ovarian cancer in 2001, after a misdiagnosis in 2000.
- Initial funding through the Listwin Family Foundation in 2002 for ovarian biomarker work at Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center (FHCRC).
- Establishment of the Center of Excellence for early cancer detection at FHCRC in 2003 by Dr. Lee Hartwell.
- Canary Center at Stanford founded in 2009 in partnership with Stanford School of Medicine and Stanford Cancer Institute, co-led by Sanjiv Sam Gambhir (1962-2020).
- Over $75 million raised historically, supporting global affiliates like Cambridge University and Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU).
- Evolution from biomarker focus to advanced imaging and precision therapies, with facility expansions like the move to Stanford’s Technology and Innovation Park in 2013 (doubling lab space).

### Programs and Research Areas
- **Prostate Team**: Canary PATROL (launched 2023: Prospective cohort for genetic risk, e.g., BRCA2 mutations, with biobanking and natural history studies); Canary PASS (launched 2008: Active surveillance for low-risk cases, over 2,000 enrolled, influencing national guidelines and reducing overtreatment).
- **Ovarian Team**: High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) research, including BRCA pre-cancer Atlas (DNA methylation, RNA, protein, spatial transcriptomics on fallopian tube samples); Validation of candidate biomarkers; Preventive strategies like surgical removal of fallopian tubes (laparoscopic, outpatient, reducing HGSC risk without early menopause).
- **Pancreas and Ultrasound Imaging**: Proof-of-concept studies for POCUS (reliable pancreas visualization at bedside); Contrast-enhanced POCUS using microbubbles (harmonic signals for isolation); Molecular imaging with targeted microbubbles; New cancer imaging center at UCSD focusing on low-cost ultrasound for biomarker confirmation.
- **Other Cancer Areas**: Lung (biomarkers for high-risk never-smokers, national screening trials with MD Anderson); Breast (microbubble clinical trials, imaging); Pancreatic (gene mutations discovered 2006, microbubble imaging below 1mm in 2011).
- **Cross-Cutting Technologies**: Biomarkers (e.g., exosomes, glycoproteins, HE4 for ovarian validated 2008); Imaging (photoacoustic devices, magneto-nano sensors 10,000x more sensitive in 2009); Machine learning (Canary Quantum Cloud developed 2015).
