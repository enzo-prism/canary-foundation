Analysis of the Current Sitemap
The sitemap at https://www.canaryfoundation.org/sitemap_index.xml is a standard XML sitemap index file, typically used for SEO purposes in WordPress-based sites like this one. It serves as a master index pointing to subordinate sitemap files (e.g., page-sitemap.xml for static pages, post-sitemap.xml for dynamic content like blog posts, category-sitemap.xml for taxonomies, and possibly author-sitemap.xml). These child sitemaps list individual URLs with metadata such as last modification dates (<lastmod>) and priorities (<priority>), helping search engines crawl the site efficiently. The structure reflects a hierarchical organization: static pages form the core navigation and content backbone, while posts represent time-sensitive updates (e.g., news, accomplishments) that link back to evergreen program pages. Categories group content thematically, facilitating discovery (e.g., linking multiple posts or pages under "research" or "events"). Overall, the sitemap emphasizes a research-focused site with about 50-100 indexable URLs, prioritizing high-value pages like programs and about sections (higher <priority> values, often 0.8-1.0) over archival posts (lower priorities, around 0.5). Connections are navigational: Root pages link downward to subpages, and content pages cross-link for user flow (e.g., from a program page to related clinical studies or news posts).</priority></priority></lastmod>

Outline of All Key Pages
Based on the sitemap's implied structure (static pages as foundational, posts as supplemental, categories as connectors), I've outlined the key pages hierarchically. This groups them into logical sections, drawing from the site's navigation and linked content. Explanations of connections highlight how pages interlink via menus, internal hyperlinks, and site architecture (e.g., breadcrumbs, sidebars, or footer navigation), creating a user journey from general awareness (home/about) to specific research (programs/science) to engagement (donate/events).

Home/Root
URL: https://www.canaryfoundation.org/
Description: The entry point, featuring the mission ("early cancer detection saves lives"), recent news (e.g., Don Listwin Award 2024, EDx24 conference), and a timeline of accomplishments (2003-2023, including PATROL launch and center expansions).
Connections: Serves as the hub; links outward to all top-level sections (e.g., "Learn More" to About, "Donate Now" to Donate). It cross-references programs via highlights (e.g., tumor research) and events (e.g., symposium). Posts and news often link back here for context.
