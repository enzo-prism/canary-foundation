For those of us who work at the Canary Foundation, our work is more than a job—it’s a calling.

Don Listwin, Founder, CEO, Co-Chairman

“After 30 years in the technology industry, I launched Canary Foundation in 2004. I was motivated by a personal experience with cancer.

When my mother was misdiagnosed and died from ovarian cancer, I decided to commit my life to advancing early detection diagnostics.” — Don Listwin

When Don Listwin walked away from his high profile technology career to launch Canary Foundation, his motivation was driven by his family’s experience with cancer. His father was a colon cancer survivor and his mother died of ovarian cancer. Her death prompted him to become personally involved in finding a cure — pledging millions of dollars to early detection research at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Stanford Medical School, UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, and other leading cancer institutions. Today, Don’s personal overall financial commitments to cancer research have surpassed $25 million.

Prior to founding the Canary Foundation, Don was CEO of Sana Security, Openwave, and had been the #2 executive at Cisco Systems. Don serves on the board of directors of several private and public companies including Calix Networks, D-Wave, Plumgrid, Teradici, Violin Memory and is a venture partner at Rally Ventures.

Don is also deeply involved with other cancer-related organizations. He is on the External Advisory Board for the Center for Cancer Nanotechnology Excellence (CCNE) at Stanford and is a member of the Stanford Advisory Board for the Canary Center for Cancer Early Detection at Stanford. He also serves as a member of The Melanoma Cancer Center at The Moffitt Cancer Center. In 2009, he was appointed to the National Cancer Institute’s Board of Scientific Advisors.

A native of Canada, Listwin holds a B.S. in electrical engineering and an honorary doctorate of law from the University of Saskatchewan.
