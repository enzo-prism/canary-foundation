10 more years… Imagine the gift of 10 more years after hearing the big, ugly C word. Unfortunately, today that gift is rare—a vast majority of patients live a few months past their diagnosis. Early detection can change that.
10 more years for a parent translates to giving your kids the foundation to be a good human being. 10 more years means a parent could watch his or her child graduate and go to prom. 10 more years may mean living to hold your grandchild. We may not be able to cure cancer in this lifetime, but we definitely have a shot at early detection, early treatment and loving life longer.

Our Focus: 5 Cancer Types—How Many Lives Saved?
What if we could improve lung cancer screening for all people, regardless of smoking status? Or what if we found a way to identify ovarian cancer long before it became lethal? And why can’t benign breast cancer tissue be more easily identified from cancerous tissue, resulting in less worry and trauma for the patient? This is the program work done at the Canary Foundation.

Dr. Sanjiv (Sam) Gambhir discusses next-generation technologies being developed at Canary Center at Stanford
More
Today, our clinical programs cover tumors across five cancer types: breast, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate. As part of our approach, we pull together multidisciplinary teams that approach cancer problems in new ways. Each team works with a practicing oncologist, focusing on a specific clinical problem, and many of these teams now have ongoing clinical trials underway. They know, and we know, that identifying early stage cancers saves lives.


Tumors
Tumors
Finding Tissue Abnormalities
Is it benign or malignant? Two words that carry a huge amount of emotional weight for patients, of course, and for the doctors caring for those patients. So what if finding tissue abnormalities was less invasive, less expensive, and offered fewer false-positives and more reliable results? Canary’s work on tumors across a range of cancer types focuses on earlier detection and the use of advanced technologies to better image tumor formation and distinguish cancer from benign disease.


Clinical Progress
Clinical Progress
From Theory to Tractable Problem to Clinical Studies
The goal of our cancer programs is to develop early detection screening strategies, consisting of blood tests and molecular imaging techniques, that will allow us to detect lethal cancers early enough to be curable.

Canary-Originated Worldclass Research Centers
At the Canary Foundation, we are proud of our deep access to some of the best minds in cancer research and our groundbreaking university/research center collaborations.
More
It all began when Canary Founder Don Listwin discovered the work of epidemiologist Dr. Nicole Urban and a new field called biomarkers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle in 2001. He ended up funding some of her work and then later met Nobel Laureate Dr. Lee Hartwell, director of the center. Don’s $10-million investment helped establish the core of a biomarker discovery and analysis program at the HUTCH, and the HUTCH remains one of Canary’s ‘Centers of Excellence’ today. But it didn’t stop there. In 2009, we forged a collaboration with Stanford University to create the Canary Center at Stanford, a world-class facility dedicated to early cancer detection research programs.
The Canary Center at Stanford is the model for future early cancer detection centers that will be developed. Our approach is to build a self-sustaining platform that will enable everything from renowned research facilities to collaborations with academia, ongoing clinical programs, and successful spinouts of diagnostic companies. In just 10 years we’ve achieved significant milestones and key accomplishments with numerous institutions, think what is possible in the next 10 years.

Canary Center at Stanford
Canary Center at Stanford
At the Canary Center at Stanford, world-class scientists from different disciplines combine their strengths to build tools for early cancer detection with the ultimate goal of saving lives.
More
The mission of the Canary Center at Stanford is to foster research leading to the development of blood tests and molecular imaging approaches to detect and localize early cancers, because early intervention is far more effective than late stage cancer treatment. We envision a two-pronged diagnostic strategy consisting of blood-based diagnostic tests to identify individuals who are likely to have cancer, paired with molecular imaging to pinpoint and verify a specific cancer type. The Canary Center at Stanford is the first in the world to integrate research on both in vivo and in vitro diagnostics to deliver these tests, by housing state-of-the-art core facilities and collaborative research programs in molecular imaging, proteomics, chemistry, and bioinformatics. These initiatives have extensive links to the Cancer Center at Stanford, forming a direct pipeline for the translation of early cancer detection research into clinical trials and clinical practice.

Saving Lives Through Early Cancer Detection
The future could include cancer screening as simple as a urine or blood test at your annual physical or an inexpensive imaging test. Signs of cancer could be exposed before they technically become cancerous. And treatment could be so minor that you might forget you were ever treated.
Finding Early Cancer—the Needle in the Haystack
Bringing top scientists, clinicians, and engineers together, the Canary Center at Stanford is the only place exclusively committed to developing both blood and imaging tools and techniques for the early diagnosis of the world’s most aggressive cancers.
More
Our Future—From Discoveries to Clinical Practice
In subsequent years, we will continue this work but will also begin building the infrastructure needed to translate discoveries into clinical practice and to create “the” international educational “hot-spot” for early cancer connections and training. All of these activities will fuel the development of minimally invasive strategies that can be used every day by clinicians around the world. As successes occur, we at the Canary Center are committed to sharing breakthroughs broadly with communities, clinicians, and scientists to ensure that impacts have multiplying effects.

Early Cancer Detection Research at the HUTCH
After the death of Grace Listwin in 2001, her son Don set out to find a research institution that focused on the early detection of ovarian cancer. The search led to a researcher by the name of Dr. Nicole Urban located in Seattle at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC). Initial meetings focused on the idea of blood biomarkers, proteins that are uniquely created by cancer, which would be circulating in the blood and detectable in early disease.
More
Discovering Biomarkers
Researchers at FHCRC are looking for ways to detect cancer at its earliest stages, when a patient’s chances of survival are greatest. One of the keys to this effort is the discovery of biomarkers—proteins and other molecules that indicate the presence of disease.

Publications
Publications
Publishing peer-reviewed articles and other publications in prestigious journals is an important part of the scientific process. It not only helps other researchers keep up to date with developments in their field, but it also helps better direct their own research. Since we know researchers and scientists love facts, here’s one on the history of journals: Scientific journals date back to 1665 when the French Journal des sçavans and the English Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society first began systematically publishing research results. Of course, Canary-related publications are much more recent. Sit back, and enjoy the read.
